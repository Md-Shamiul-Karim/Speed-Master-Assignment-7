            <h1 class="info">Session Storage vs. Local Storage: What Are the Differences?</h1>
            <small>Session and local storage are both easy-to-use client-side data stores you can access using
                JavaScript. So how do they differ?</small>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Session storage</strong> is unique to each browser tab. If you open a new tab and navigate to
                    the
                    same site, you'll start a new session with its own storage. However, if you use a "duplicate tab"
                    feature in your browser, that may reuse the same session. You can't rely too much on the specific
                    details of a "session". Instead, focus on the core concept: session storage is temporary.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Session storage has built-in API methods to work with key/value pair data. You can store data
                        from
                        JavaScript like so:</i>
                    <span class="green centerText">sessionStorage.setItem("key","value");</span>
                    <br>
                    <i>And to retrieve the stored value:</i>
                    <span class="green centerText">sessionStorage.getItem("key");</span>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Local storage</strong> maintains data across all instances of a site, whether they're in
                    different tabs or windows. It is
                    also permanent, so the data won't disappear when you close your browser. When you open a website
                    that
                    previously used local storage, it will always have access to that stored data.As a web developer,
                    you
                    can use this mechanism to retain data about a user. Some websites might use this to keep you logged
                    in
                    or provide a more personalized experience.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Like session storage, you can set a local storage object with one line of JavaScript code:</i>
                    <span class="green centerText">localStorage.setItem("key", "value");</span>
                    <br>
                    <i>To access the value of the key:</i>
                    <span class="green centerText">localStorage.getItem("key");</span>
                    <br>
                    <i>While session storage clears data as soon as the session ends, the only way to clear local
                        storage is to explicitly delete it. Both storage types offer two methods to clear data. The
                        first removes a specific item of data based on its key:</i>
                    <span class="green centerText">localStorage.removeItem("key");</span>
                    <i>You can also remove all data stored by your site, regardless of its key:</i>
                    <span class="green centerText">localStorage.clear();</span>
                </p>
                <br>
                <div>
                    <p><b>To Summerize:</b></p>

            <h1 class="info">Differences Between Local Scope and Global Scope Variable In JavaScript</h1>
            <small>The scope of a variable defines where it’s accessible in a program based off of where it was
                created</small>
            <div>
                <strong>Global scope</strong> — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code
                blocks. A code block
                simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are
                examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is
                accessible from anywhere in the code.
                <br>
                <br>

                </div>
                <br>
                <strong>Local Scope</strong> — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable
                has local scope.A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared

                </div>
                <p>
                    Output: <br> helloWorld <br> Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined. <br><br>
                    In the above program, variable a is a global variable and variable b is a local variable. The
                    variable b can be accessed only inside the function greet. Hence, when we try to access variable b
                    outside of the function, an error occurs.

            <h1 class="info">What is an event loop in JavaScript?</h1>
            <div>
                <p>The <strong>event loop</strong> is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS
                    executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the
                    illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.</p><br>
                <p>The <strong>call stack</strong> is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be
                    executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.</p><br>
                <p>The <strong>event queue</strong> is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for
                    processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all
                    operations should be sent for execution.</p><br>
                <p>Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                    browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded
                    operation.</p><br>
                <p>The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is empty.
                    If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current
                    function call is processed.</p><br>

            <h1 class="info">What is an undefined in JavaScript?</h1>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Undefined</strong> is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global
                    scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.</p><br>
                <p>In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this
                    is not the case, avoid overriding it.)</p><br>
                <p>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also
                    returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
                    function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p><br>
